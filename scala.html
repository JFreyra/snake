	  <h2>What is Scala?</h2>
	  <p>
            Scala is short for "Scalable Language." You can play with it on a small level, testing one line of code at a time to observe the effects, or you can build massve projects and run large systems based on Scala like LinkedIn, Twitter, Foursquare, Sony, and Lichess.
	  </p>
	  <p>
Scala syntax is concise and intuitive; its types aren't a hassle because the compiler can assume what they are. Despite its apparent simplicity, Scala is the preferred language for many server systems. The generated code is on the same level as Java's and its precise typing means that many problems are caught at compile-time rather than after deployment.
	  </p>
	  <p>
At the root, the language's scalability is the result of a careful integration of object-oriented and functional language concepts.

	  <h1>Object Orientation and Functionality</h1>
	  <p>
            Scala is a object-oriented language. Every value is an object and every operation is a method-call. The language supports traditional design patterns like <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visitor_pattern">visitors</a> and <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singleton_pattern">singletons</a>. Scala also allows for the addition of new operations on classes that have been predefined like data types since every value is essentially an object. This is done through <a target="_blank" href="http://docs.scala-lang.org/overviews/core/implicit-classes.html">Implicit Classes</a>. Through Interopability, this practice works across any class in Scala and Java.
	  </p>
	  <p>
            Scala is also a full-blown functional language. It has first-class functions, a <a target="_blank" href="https://www.scala-lang.org/api/current/scala/collection/immutable/index.html">library</a> with efficient immutable data structures, and a general preference of immutability over mutation.
	  </p>
	  <p>
            You can start to use it as a "Java without semicolons". Over time, you can progress to gradually an immutable state in your code, phasing in functional coding patterns. This progression is often a good idea. At the same time, Scala is flexible and easy to work with in any style.

	    <p><a class="button copy">Copy</a></p>

<h1>Compatibiltiy</h1>
<p>
Scala allows for an easy transition from Java and other
 computing languages you may already know.
Not only does the language allow you to gradually adjust,
Scala is made so that it can be used freely along with Java clases.
The use of the Java compiler within the Scala compiler allows for this.
</p>

<p>
  It runs on most JVMs and can make use of the large pool of Java libraries,
  framworks, and tools that already exist. Scala frameworks, such as Akka, Finagle
  and the Play web, offer dual APIs for Java and Scala as well.

<h1>Language Constructs and Growth</h1>
<p>
  What makes Scala unique is its language setup and organization.
  By developing objects in a flexible manner, they can be easily combined.
  Functions and mathematical data types are defined within classes.
  Scala also supports pattern matching for arbitrary classes.
</p>

<p>
  A set of 20-50 basic methods allow the user to master most problems
  allowing them to rely less on mutable states. These methods also allow
  higher abstraction levels of organization with lightweight syntax.
</p>

<p>
  Scala then utilizes these constructs and applies them with scalable server software.
  The language allows the user to write high-performing multi-threaded code.
  It uses <a href="http://www.cs.unc.edu/~dewan/242/s07/notes/ipc/node9.html">concurrent and synchoronous processing</a> and
  <a href="http://docs.scala-lang.org/overviews/parallel-collections/overview.html">parallel</a> use of several cores.
